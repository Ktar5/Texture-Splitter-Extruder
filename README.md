# Texture-Splitter-Extruder
Made in JavaFX, this small application allows you to split up a square, tiled spritesheet into individual parts, extrude out each edge, and then pack it back together IN-PLACE.

In order to use just download, run the main file, and a GUI will popup. Select a folder to split all the textures into.
